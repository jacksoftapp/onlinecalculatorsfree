### What is a Balloon Mortgage Loan?

A balloon mortgage loan is a type of mortgage where you make lower monthly payments for a fixed period, after which you make a large final payment called a "balloon payment" to pay off the remaining balance of the loan. Typically, balloon mortgage loans have a term of five to seven years, but they can range from one to ten years.

Balloon mortgage loans are often used by real estate investors who plan to sell the property before the balloon payment is due, or by homeowners who expect to refinance their loan before the balloon payment is due.
