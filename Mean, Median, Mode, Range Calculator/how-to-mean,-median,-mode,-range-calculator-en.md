### Understanding Mean, Median, Mode, and Range

Before diving into the functionality of the calculator, let's review the fundamental concepts of mean, median, mode, and range.

- **Mean:** Also known as the average, the mean is calculated by summing up all the values in a data set and then dividing the sum by the total number of values.
- **Median:** The median is the middle value in a data set when the values are arranged in ascending order. If there is an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle numbers.
- **Mode:** The mode refers to the value that appears most frequently in a data set.
- **Range:** The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in a data set.

Understanding the significance of these statistical measures is crucial for making sense of your data and drawing meaningful conclusions.
