How to Use Rule of 72 Calculator Online Tool
============================================

Investing is a fundamental aspect of personal finance, and understanding how your investments grow over time can be crucial for making informed decisions. One concept that can help you estimate the time it takes for your investment to double is the Rule of 72. Fortunately, there are online tools available, such as the Rule of 72 Calculator, that make it easy to perform these calculations accurately and efficiently.

### What is the Rule of 72?

The Rule of 72 is a simplified formula used to estimate the time it takes for an investment to double in value based on compound interest. It assumes a constant interest rate and provides a rough approximation of the doubling time. The formula is straightforward: divide 72 by the annual interest rate, and the result will give you an approximate number of years it takes for your investment to double.

For example, if you have an investment with an annual interest rate of 6%, using the Rule of 72, it would take approximately 12 years for your investment to double (72 รท 6 = 12).
