How to Use Rankine to Kelvin Conversion Online Tool
===================================================

If you work in the field of thermodynamics or any other field that deals with temperature measurements, you may often come across different units of temperature. Two of the most commonly used units are Rankine (°R) and Kelvin (K). While both these units are used to measure temperature, they have different scales and conversion factors. In this article, we will discuss how to use the Rankine to Kelvin conversion online tool to convert temperature measurements from one unit to another.

### Basic Knowledge of Rankine and Kelvin Scales

Before we dive into the details of using the Rankine to Kelvin conversion online tool, let us first understand the basic concepts and formulas of these two temperature scales.

Rankine Scale: The Rankine scale is an absolute temperature scale based on Fahrenheit degrees. It is named after William John Macquorn Rankine, a Scottish engineer and physicist who developed the concept of absolute zero temperature. The Rankine scale starts at absolute zero (-459.67 °F) and uses Fahrenheit degrees as its unit of measurement. Therefore, the boiling point of water on the Rankine scale is 671.67 °R.

Kelvin Scale: The Kelvin scale is also an absolute temperature scale, but it is based on Celsius degrees. It is named after William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin, an Irish physicist who developed the concept of absolute temperature. The Kelvin scale starts at absolute zero (-273.15 °C) and uses Celsius degrees as its unit of measurement. Therefore, the boiling point of water on the Kelvin scale is 373.15 K.

### Using the Rankine to Kelvin Conversion Online Tool

Now that we have an understanding of the Rankine and Kelvin scales, let us move on to the main topic of this article – how to use the Rankine to Kelvin conversion online tool.

Step 1: Visit the Tool Website

The first step is to visit the Rankine to Kelvin conversion online tool website. You can access the tool at <https://www.onlinecalculatorsfree.com/convert/rankine-to-kelvin.html>.
