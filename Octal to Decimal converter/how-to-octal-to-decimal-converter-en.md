### What is Octal and Decimal Number System?

Before we dive into the use of the octal to decimal converter, let's first understand what octal and decimal number systems are.

Octal number system is a base-8 numbering system that uses eight distinct symbols, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7, to represent any number. In computer programming, octal numbers are commonly used to represent sets of binary digits. For instance, the octal number 7432 represents the binary number 111 100 011 010.

On the other hand, decimal number system is a base-10 numbering system that uses ten distinct symbols, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9, to represent any number. Decimal numbers are widely used in everyday life, such as telling time, measuring distance, and counting money.

### How to Use Octal to Decimal Converter Online Tool

Step 2: You will be presented with a simple interface that has two input fields. In the "Octal" field, enter the octal number you want to convert to decimal. For instance, let's convert the octal number 7432 to decimal.

Step 3: After entering the octal number, click the "Convert" button located next to the "Octal" field. The tool will automatically calculate the decimal equivalent of the octal number and display it in the "Decimal" field.

Step 4: You can now copy the decimal value and use it in your programming or other technical work. In our example, the decimal value of the octal number 7432 is 3850.

### Octal to Decimal Conversion Formula

For those interested in understanding how the octal to decimal conversion works, here is the formula used by the online tool:

Decimal = (8^0 \* last digit) + (8^1 \* second-last digit) + (8^2 \* third-last digit) + ...

For instance, let's use the formula to convert the octal number 7432 to decimal:

Decimal = (8^0 \* 2) + (8^1 \* 3) + (8^2 \* 4) + (8^3 \* 7) Decimal = 2 + 24 + 256 + 1792 Decimal = 2074

As you can see, the formula involves multiplying each octal digit by the appropriate power of 8 and then adding the products together to obtain the decimal value.

### Conclusion

In summary, the octal to decimal converter online tool is an efficient and convenient way of converting octal numbers to decimal. It's easy to use and saves time for individuals working in technical fields that require octal to decimal conversion. We hope this article has given you a clear understanding of how to use this tool and the basics of octal and decimal number systems.
