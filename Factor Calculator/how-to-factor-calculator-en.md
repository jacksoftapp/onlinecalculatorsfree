How to Use Factor Calculator Online Tool
========================================

Are you tired of manually calculating factors and prime factors of a number? Look no further! With the help of a factor calculator online tool, you can easily compute the factors and prime factors of any given integer. Gone are the days of tedious calculations â€“ this tool simplifies the process and provides you with accurate results in no time.

### Understanding Factors and Prime Factors

Before we delve into how to use the factor calculator online tool, let's first understand what factors and prime factors are.

Factors are the numbers that can be multiplied together to give a particular number. For example, the factors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12. When these factors are multiplied together (1 x 12, 2 x 6, 3 x 4), they result in 12.

Prime factors, on the other hand, are the factors that are prime numbers. A prime number is a number greater than 1 that is divisible only by 1 and itself. For example, the prime factors of 12 are 2 and 3.

Now that we have a clear understanding of factors and prime factors, let's move on to using the factor calculator online tool.
