### Understanding Nanocoulombs and Coulombs

Before we delve into the tool itself, let's have a quick overview of what nanocoulombs and coulombs represent. Both nanocoulombs and coulombs are units used to measure electric charge.

A nanocoulomb is equal to one billionth of a coulomb, represented as 1 nC = 10^-9 C. It is often used when dealing with small amounts of electric charge, such as in microelectronics or in scientific research.

On the other hand, a coulomb is the SI unit for electric charge. It is defined as the amount of charge transferred by a current of one ampere in one second. One coulomb is equivalent to approximately 6.242 Ã— 10^18 elementary charges.
