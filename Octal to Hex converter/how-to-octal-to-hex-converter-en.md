Before we dive into the details of how to use the Octal to Hex Converter online tool, let's first understand the basics of octal and hexadecimal number systems.

### Octal Numbers

The octal number system is a base-8 numbering system. It uses digits from 0 to 7 to represent numbers. Just like the decimal system, where the base is 10, the octal system's base is 8. Here are a few examples of octal numbers:

- 10 (in octal) = 1 \* 8^1 + 0 \* 8^0 = 8
- 17 (in octal) = 1 \* 8^1 + 7 \* 8^0 = 15

### Hexadecimal Numbers

The hexadecimal number system is a base-16 numbering system. It uses digits from 0 to 9 and letters from A to F to represent numbers. In the hexadecimal system, the base is 16. Here are a few examples of hexadecimal numbers:

- 1A (in hexadecimal) = 1 \* 16^1 + 10 \* 16^0 = 26
- 2F (in hexadecimal) = 2 \* 16^1 + 15 \* 16^0 = 47
