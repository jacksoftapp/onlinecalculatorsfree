### Understanding the Basics: Capitalization Rate

Before diving into the specifics of the Cap Rate Calculator, let's first understand what capitalization rate is and why it is crucial for real estate analysis and valuation.

The capitalization rate, also known as the cap rate, is a financial metric used to determine the potential return on investment in a real estate property. It is calculated by dividing the property's net operating income (NOI) by its current market value. The resulting percentage represents the annual return an investor can expect from the property.

A high cap rate indicates a higher potential return on investment, while a low cap rate suggests a lower return. The cap rate helps investors compare different properties and assess their profitability. It is an essential tool for making informed investment decisions.
