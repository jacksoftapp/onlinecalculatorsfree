Before we dive into the details of using the savings calculator online tool, let's first understand some key concepts related to savings and interest.

1. **Savings:** Savings refer to the money you set aside for future use or emergencies. It is crucial to have a savings plan in place to achieve financial security and meet your long-term goals.

3. **Interest Rate:** The interest rate is the percentage at which your savings will grow over time. It is usually expressed annually and can vary depending on the type of savings account or investment product.

Now that we have a clear understanding of these terms, let's move on to using the savings calculator online tool.
