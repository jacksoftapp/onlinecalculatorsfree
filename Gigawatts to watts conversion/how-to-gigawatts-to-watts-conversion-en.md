### Understanding the Basics: Gigawatts and Watts

Before we dive into the details of using our gigawatts to watts conversion tool, let's quickly refresh our knowledge on these units of power.

A gigawatt is a unit of power equal to one billion watts or 1,000,000,000 watts. It is commonly used to measure large-scale power production, such as the output of power plants or the energy consumption of entire countries. The prefix "giga" denotes a factor of 10^9, which means there are nine zeros following the number.

On the other hand, a watt is the standard unit of power in the International System of Units (SI). It is named after James Watt, the Scottish inventor who made significant contributions to the development of the steam engine. One watt is equal to one joule of energy per second. Watts are commonly used to measure everyday power consumption, such as the energy usage of appliances or the output of light bulbs.
