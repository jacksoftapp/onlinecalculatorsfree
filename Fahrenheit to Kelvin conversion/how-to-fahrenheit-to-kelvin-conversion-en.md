Fahrenheit to Kelvin Conversion: Easily Convert Temperature in °F to K
======================================================================

Temperature conversion is a common task when working with different temperature scales. One such conversion is from Fahrenheit (°F) to Kelvin (K) degrees. If you're looking for a convenient and reliable online tool to convert Fahrenheit to Kelvin, look no further. In this article, we will introduce an efficient online tool and guide you through the process of converting temperatures effortlessly.

### Understanding Fahrenheit and Kelvin Scales

Before we dive into the conversion process, let's briefly discuss the Fahrenheit and Kelvin temperature scales.

The Fahrenheit scale is commonly used in the United States and a few other countries for everyday temperature measurements. On this scale, the freezing point of water is 32°F and the boiling point is 212°F. The Fahrenheit scale divides the range between these two points into 180 equal parts.

The Kelvin scale, on the other hand, is an absolute temperature scale widely used in scientific and engineering fields. It starts at absolute zero, which is the lowest possible temperature, where all molecular motion ceases. Absolute zero is defined as 0 Kelvin (0K). The Kelvin scale has the same degree increment size as the Celsius scale, where the freezing point of water is 273.15K and the boiling point is 373.15K.
