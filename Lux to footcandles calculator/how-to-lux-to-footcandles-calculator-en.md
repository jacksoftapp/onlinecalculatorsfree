### Understanding Lux and Footcandles

Before we dive into the details of using the Lux to Footcandles Calculator Online Tool, let's briefly understand what lux and footcandles are.

Lux (lx) is the metric unit of measure for illuminance, which indicates the amount of light that falls on a surface. Specifically, it measures the intensity of light in lumens per square meter (lm/m²). Lux is commonly used in countries that adhere to the International System of Units (SI), including most European nations.

Footcandles (fc), on the other hand, is the imperial unit of measure for illuminance. It represents the amount of light that falls on a surface in lumens per square foot (lm/ft²). Footcandles are predominantly used in the United States and other countries that follow the Imperial system of measurement.

While both lux and footcandles serve the same purpose of measuring illuminance, their numerical values differ due to the conversion factor between the metric and imperial systems.
