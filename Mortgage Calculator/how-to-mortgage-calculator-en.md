Are you considering buying a new home or refinancing your existing mortgage? It's essential to have a clear understanding of your financial obligations before making any decisions. One useful tool that can help you in this process is a mortgage calculator. In this article, we will introduce you to the basic knowledge of this tool and provide a step-by-step guide on how to use it effectively.

### What is a Mortgage Calculator?

A mortgage calculator is an online tool designed to help individuals estimate their monthly mortgage payments based on various factors such as loan amount, interest rate, and loan term. It allows you to get a realistic idea of what your monthly expenses will be, enabling you to plan your finances accordingly.

Using a mortgage calculator can save you time and effort by eliminating the need for complex manual calculations. It provides you with accurate and instant results, allowing you to explore different scenarios and make informed decisions about your home loan.
