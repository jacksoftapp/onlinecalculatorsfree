Understanding the CAPM Calculator: A Comprehensive Guide
========================================================

In the realm of financial analysis, the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) serves as a fundamental tool for estimating the expected return on investment. By leveraging the CAPM Calculator, individuals can gain valuable insights into risk assessment and make informed decisions regarding their investments. This article will delve into the basic principles behind the CAPM model and provide a comprehensive guide on utilizing the online CAPM Calculator effectively.

### Exploring the Basics of CAPM

The Capital Asset Pricing Model is a vital concept in finance, aiming to determine the appropriate rate of return for an investment based on its risk and the overall market conditions. At its core, the CAPM formula is expressed as follows:

\[ E(R\_i) = R\_f + eta\_i imes (E(R\_m) - R\_f) \]

Where:

- ( E(R\_i) ) represents the expected return on the investment
- ( R\_f ) denotes the risk-free rate
- ( eta\_i ) stands for the beta of the investment
- ( E(R\_m) ) signifies the expected market return

### Introducing the CAPM Calculator
