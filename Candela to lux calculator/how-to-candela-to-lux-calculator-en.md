How to Use Candela to Lux Calculator Online Tool
================================================

If you are in the lighting industry or just interested in measuring the brightness of a light source, you might have heard about the terms "candela" and "lux." Candela measures the luminous intensity of a light source while lux measures the illuminance received by a surface. Converting candela to lux requires some mathematical calculations, but thanks to the Candela to Lux Calculator Online Tool, the process has become much easier.

**What is Candela to Lux Calculator Online Tool?**

The Candela to Lux Calculator is an online tool that helps you convert luminous intensity (measured in candela) to illuminance (measured in lux). This tool is free to use and available on the website [onlinecalculatorsfree.com](http://onlinecalculatorsfree.com).

**How to Use Candela to Lux Calculator Online Tool?**

Using the Candela to Lux Calculator Online Tool is quite easy. Here are the steps you need to follow:

Step 1: Open the tool link: <https://www.onlinecalculatorsfree.com/tools/candela-to-lux-calculator.html>

Step 2: Enter the luminous intensity in candela (cd) in the first input field.

Step 3: Enter the distance from the light source in meters (m) in the second input field.

Step 4: Click on the "Calculate" button.

Step 5: The tool will automatically convert the candela value to lux and display it in the result field.

**Formula for Converting Candela to Lux**

The Candela to Lux Calculator Online Tool uses the following formula to convert luminous intensity in candela to illuminance in lux:

Lux = Candela / Distance^2

Where Lux is the illuminance in lux, Candela is the luminous intensity in candela, and Distance is the distance from the light source in meters.

**Conclusion**

The Candela to Lux Calculator Online Tool is a useful tool for anyone who wants to convert luminous intensity in candela to illuminance in lux. Using this tool, you can easily calculate the brightness of a light source and determine the illuminance received by a surface at a certain distance. Whether you are in the lighting industry or just interested in measuring the brightness of a light source, this tool can save you time and effort.
