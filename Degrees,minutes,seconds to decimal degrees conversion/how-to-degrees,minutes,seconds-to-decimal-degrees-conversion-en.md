How to Use Degrees, Minutes, Seconds to Decimal Degrees Conversion Online Tool
==============================================================================

Converting between different units of measurement is a common task in various fields, and geographical coordinates are no exception. If you often work with degrees, minutes, and seconds (DMS) for latitude and longitude values, you may find it useful to use an online tool that simplifies the conversion process. In this article, we will introduce a fast and easy-to-use online tool for converting DMS to decimal degrees.

### Understanding Degrees, Minutes, and Seconds (DMS)

Before we delve into the details of the conversion tool, let's quickly review the basic concept of degrees, minutes, and seconds. In the context of geographic coordinates, DMS is a way to represent angles.

A degree (°) is the most common unit of measurement for angles. It represents 1/360th of a full rotation. A degree can be further divided into minutes ('), with each degree containing 60 minutes. Similarly, each minute can be divided into seconds (''), with each minute containing 60 seconds.

For example, if you have the coordinates 37° 30' 15'', it means 37 degrees, 30 minutes, and 15 seconds.
