### Understanding Number Systems

Before diving into the practical use of the base converter tool, it's essential to have a basic understanding of different number systems. The most commonly used number systems are:

1. **Binary (Base 2):** This system uses only two digits, 0 and 1, to represent numbers.
2. **Decimal (Base 10):** The decimal system is familiar to most people, using digits 0 through 9 to represent numbers.
3. **Octal (Base 8):** This system uses digits 0 through 7 to represent numbers.
4. **Hexadecimal (Base 16):** The hexadecimal system uses digits 0 through 9 and letters A to F to represent numbers.

Each number system has its unique properties and applications, and being able to convert between them is a valuable skill in various fields, including computer programming, digital electronics, and networking.
