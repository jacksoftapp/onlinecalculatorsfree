How to Use the Fahrenheit to Rankine Conversion Online Tool
===========================================================

Introduction: In the field of thermodynamics, temperature can be measured and expressed in various units. Fahrenheit (°F) and Rankine (°R) are two commonly used temperature scales. If you need to convert temperatures from Fahrenheit to Rankine or vice versa, an online conversion tool can make your task quick and effortless. This article will introduce you to a user-friendly online tool for Fahrenheit to Rankine conversion and guide you through its usage.

Understanding Fahrenheit and Rankine Scales: Before diving into the online tool, let's briefly understand the Fahrenheit and Rankine temperature scales. The Fahrenheit scale is primarily used in the United States and a few other countries. It divides the temperature range between the freezing point of water and the boiling point of water into 180 equal divisions or degrees. On the Fahrenheit scale, the freezing point of water is 32°F, and the boiling point is 212°F.

The Rankine scale, on the other hand, is an absolute temperature scale commonly used in engineering and scientific applications. It has the same degree increments as the Fahrenheit scale but starts at absolute zero, which is equivalent to -459.67°F. The Rankine scale uses the symbol °R to denote its temperature units.

Introducing the Online Conversion Tool: To simplify the Fahrenheit to Rankine conversion process, an online calculator can come in handy. One reliable tool for this purpose is the "Fahrenheit to Rankine Conversion" tool available at [OnlineCalculatorsFree.com](http://OnlineCalculatorsFree.com). This user-friendly tool allows you to quickly convert temperatures between Fahrenheit and Rankine with just a few clicks.
