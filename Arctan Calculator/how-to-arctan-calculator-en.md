How to Use Arctan Calculator Online Tool
========================================

The arctan function, also known as the inverse tangent function, is a fundamental tool for calculating angles and trigonometric values. With the advent of online calculators, utilizing the arctan function has become more convenient than ever. In this article, we will explore the basic knowledge of the arctan function and introduce how to use an online arctan calculator to simplify your calculations effortlessly.

### Basic Knowledge of the Arctan Function

The arctan function is the inverse of the tangent function. It is used to determine the angle whose tangent is a given number. In other words, if y = tan(x), then x = arctan(y). The result is expressed in either degrees (°) or radians (rad), depending on the user's preference.
