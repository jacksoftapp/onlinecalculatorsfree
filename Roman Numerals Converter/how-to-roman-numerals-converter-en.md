How to Use Roman Numerals Converter Online Tool
===============================================

Roman numerals are a system of numerical notation that originated in ancient Rome. While they are not commonly used in everyday life today, they still hold significance in various fields, such as typography, clock faces, and movie credits. Converting Arabic numbers to Roman numerals or vice versa can be a challenging task if you're not familiar with the rules. However, with the help of an online tool like the Roman Numerals Converter, the process becomes quick and effortless.

### Understanding Roman Numerals

Before diving into how to use the Roman Numerals Converter online tool, it's essential to have a basic understanding of how Roman numerals work. Here's a quick overview:

Roman numerals comprise seven basic symbols:

- I: 1
- V: 5
- X: 10
- L: 50
- C: 100
- D: 500
- M: 1000

These symbols can be combined to represent different numbers. The position of the symbols and their order determine the value they contribute to the overall number. For example, "II" represents 2, "VIII" represents 8, and "XIV" represents 14.

There are specific rules to keep in mind when working with Roman numerals:

1. When a smaller symbol appears before a larger symbol, you subtract the smaller value from the larger value. For example, "IV" represents 4 (5 - 1).
2. If a smaller symbol appears after a larger symbol, you add the smaller value to the larger value. For instance, "VI" represents 6 (5 + 1).
