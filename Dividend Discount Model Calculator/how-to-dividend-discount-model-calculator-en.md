=========================================================

As an investor, one of your main goals is to find undervalued stocks that can provide a good return on investment. The Dividend Discount Model Calculator is a powerful online tool that can help you achieve that goal by accurately estimating the intrinsic value of a stock based on its dividend payments.

<div>### What is the Dividend Discount Model?

The Dividend Discount Model (DDM) is a valuation method that uses the present value of future dividend payments to estimate the intrinsic value of a stock. It assumes that the present value of a stock is equal to the present value of all its future dividends discounted back to today's dollars using a discount rate. In other words, the DDM calculates the present value of all expected future cash flows in the form of dividends.

The DDM is based on the idea that the value of a stock is ultimately determined by the cash flows it generates for its shareholders in the form of dividends. Therefore, the intrinsic value of a stock can be estimated by calculating the present value of those future dividends.
