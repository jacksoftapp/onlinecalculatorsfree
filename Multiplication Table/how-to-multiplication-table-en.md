### The Basics of the Multiplication Table

Before we dive into the details of the online tool, let's quickly refresh our knowledge on the multiplication table. The multiplication table, also known as the times table, is a grid-like structure that displays the products of multiplying two numbers from 1 to 10. It is a fundamental tool used in mathematics education to teach multiplication and help students understand the relationships between numbers.

The multiplication table consists of rows and columns. The numbers from 1 to 10 are represented along both the horizontal and vertical axes. The product of multiplying two numbers is found at the intersection of their corresponding row and column. For example, if you want to find the product of 4 and 6, you would locate the cell where the row labeled "4" intersects with the column labeled "6," and the value displayed in that cell would be the product, which in this case is 24.
