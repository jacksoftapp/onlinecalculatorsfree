Understanding Celsius to Kelvin Conversion and the Online Tool
==============================================================

When it comes to understanding temperature measurements, the conversion from Celsius to Kelvin is a fundamental concept. Both Celsius (°C) and Kelvin (K) are units of temperature measurement, and they are related through a simple mathematical formula. To facilitate this conversion, online tools offer a convenient way to quickly and accurately convert temperatures from Celsius to Kelvin.

### Basic Knowledge of Celsius to Kelvin Conversion

Celsius and Kelvin are two temperature scales that are commonly used in scientific and everyday contexts. The Celsius scale is based on the freezing and boiling points of water, with 0°C representing the freezing point and 100°C representing the boiling point at standard atmospheric pressure. On the other hand, the Kelvin scale is an absolute temperature scale where 0K represents absolute zero, the lowest possible temperature.

The relationship between Celsius and Kelvin can be represented by the following formula: \[ K = °C + 273.15 \] Here, K represents the temperature in Kelvin and °C represents the temperature in Celsius. By adding 273.15 to the temperature in Celsius, you can easily convert it to Kelvin.
