Understanding Electron-volts and Joules
---------------------------------------

Before we dive into the conversion process, let's first understand the basic concepts of electron-volts and joules.

Electron-volt (eV) is a unit of energy commonly used in physics and chemistry. It represents the amount of kinetic energy gained or lost by an electron when it passes through an electric potential difference of one volt. One electron-volt is equivalent to approximately 1.602 x 10^-19 joules.

On the other hand, joule (J) is the standard unit of energy in the International System of Units (SI). It is defined as the work done when a force of one newton is applied over a distance of one meter. Joules are widely used in various scientific and engineering fields.
