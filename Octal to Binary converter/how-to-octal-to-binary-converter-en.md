### Understanding Octal and Binary Number Systems

Before we dive into how to use the Octal to Binary Converter, let's first understand the basics of the octal and binary number systems.

Octal is a base-8 number system, meaning it uses eight unique digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. In octal, each digit represents three bits, and the place value increases by powers of 8.

Binary, on the other hand, is a base-2 number system. It uses only two digits: 0 and 1. Each digit in a binary number represents a power of 2, with the rightmost bit representing 2^0, the next one representing 2^1, then 2^2, and so on.

Converting octal numbers to binary can be tedious and time-consuming if done manually. That's where the Octal to Binary Converter online tool comes in handy!
