In this article, we will introduce an online tool, the Lux to Watts Calculator, which simplifies this conversion process. We will also guide you through the steps to effectively use this tool.

**Understanding Lux and Watts**

Before we delve into the Lux to Watts Calculator, let's quickly understand the concepts of lux and watts.

**Lux:** Lux is the metric unit used to measure illuminance, which refers to the amount of light falling on a surface. It is defined as the number of lumens per square meter (lm/m²). Lux is commonly used in fields such as lighting design, architecture, and photography to ensure optimal lighting conditions.

**Watts:** Watts, on the other hand, measure electric power. It indicates the rate at which energy is consumed or produced. When it comes to lighting, watts typically represent the power consumption of a light bulb or luminaire.
