### Understanding the Simple Moving Average (SMA)

Before we delve into the specifics of the Simple Moving Average Calculator, let's take a moment to understand the concept of the Simple Moving Average (SMA). The SMA is a widely used statistical calculation that helps in analyzing data trends over time. It provides a smoothed line that represents the average value of a set of data points within a specified time period.

The SMA is particularly useful when dealing with time series data, such as stock prices, sales figures, or any other data that changes over time. By calculating the SMA, you can identify trends, patterns, and potential reversals in the data.
