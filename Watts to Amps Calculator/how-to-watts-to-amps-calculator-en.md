### Understanding Watts and Amps

Before we dive into the functionality of the Watts to Amps Calculator, let's take a moment to understand the concepts of watts and amps.

Watts (W) represent the unit of measurement for electric power. It indicates the rate at which electrical energy is consumed or produced. In simple terms, watts measure the amount of work done by an electrical device or system.

Amps (A), on the other hand, refer to the unit of measurement for electric current. Amperes measure the flow of electric charge through a specific point in an electric circuit. It determines the amount of electrical current passing through a conductor.

Understanding the relationship between watts and amps is crucial when working with electrical systems. The Watts to Amps Calculator simplifies these calculations and provides instant results, saving you time and effort.
