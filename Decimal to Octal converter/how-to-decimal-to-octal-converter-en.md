### Understanding Decimal and Octal Number Systems

Before we delve into the conversion process, let's briefly understand the decimal and octal number systems.

The decimal system, also known as the base-10 system, is the most commonly used number system. It uses ten digits (0-9) to represent numbers, and each digit's position represents a power of 10. For example, in the decimal number 356, the digit '3' represents 300 (10^2), the digit '5' represents 50 (10^1), and the digit '6' represents 6 (10^0). The sum of these values gives us the decimal equivalent, which is 356.

On the other hand, the octal system, also known as the base-8 system, uses eight digits (0-7) to represent numbers. Each digit's position corresponds to a power of 8. For example, in the octal number 27, the digit '2' represents 20 (8^1) and the digit '7' represents 7 (8^0). The sum of these values gives us the octal equivalent, which is 23 in decimal notation.
