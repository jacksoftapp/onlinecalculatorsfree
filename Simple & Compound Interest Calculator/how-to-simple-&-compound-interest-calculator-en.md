In the world of finance, understanding how interest works is crucial for making informed investment decisions. Whether you're saving for retirement, planning for a big purchase, or simply looking to grow your wealth, a simple and compound interest calculator can be an invaluable tool. This online calculator allows you to accurately estimate the interest earned on your investments, taking into account various factors such as interest rates, compounding periods, and investment durations.

### What is a Simple &amp; Compound Interest Calculator?

A simple and compound interest calculator is a financial tool that helps individuals calculate the interest earned on their investments. It takes into account two types of interest calculations: simple interest and compound interest.

**Simple Interest:** Simple interest is calculated based on the principal amount, the interest rate, and the time period. It is expressed using the formula:

Simple Interest = (Principal Amount) x (Interest Rate) x (Time Period)

**Compound Interest:** Compound interest, on the other hand, takes into account the initial principal amount, the interest rate, the compounding period, and the time period. It is calculated using the formula:

Compound Interest = (Principal Amount) x \[(1 + (Interest Rate / Compounding Period)) ^ (Compounding Period x Time Period)\] - (Principal Amount)
