How to Use Refrigeration Tons to Kilowatts Conversion Online Tool
=================================================================

If you work in the field of refrigeration or HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning), you may come across the need to convert between different units of power. One common conversion is between refrigeration tons (RT) and kilowatts (kW). To simplify this process, an online tool can be used to quickly and accurately perform the conversion. In this article, we will introduce a reliable online tool and guide you through the step-by-step process of using it.

### Understanding Refrigeration Tons and Kilowatts

Before we delve into the conversion process, let's briefly understand what refrigeration tons and kilowatts are.

Refrigeration ton is a unit of power used in the refrigeration and air conditioning industries. It represents the cooling capacity of an air conditioning system. One refrigeration ton is equal to 12,000 British thermal units (BTUs) per hour. In simpler terms, it is the amount of heat needed to melt one ton of ice in 24 hours.

Kilowatt, on the other hand, is a unit of power commonly used in the scientific and engineering fields. It measures the rate at which energy is consumed or produced. Kilowatts are often used to describe the power output of electrical devices or the cooling capacity of air conditioning systems.
