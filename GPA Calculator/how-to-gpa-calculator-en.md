Our GPA calculator is the perfect tool for generating a comprehensive report based on your course credits and grades. Whether you receive numerical or letter grades, our user-friendly calculator accommodates both formats to provide precise GPA calculations.

Understanding the Basics
------------------------

Before delving into how to use the GPA calculator, it's essential to understand the basic knowledge behind this invaluable tool. Your GPA is a numerical representation of your academic performance, typically ranging from 0.0 to 4.0 in the United States. It serves as a quick reference point for potential employers and academic institutions to gauge your scholastic achievements.

The GPA is calculated by averaging the grades you receive in your courses, weighted by the credit hours of each course. This means that a higher grade in a more challenging class will have a greater impact on your GPA than the same grade in a less challenging class.

Using the GPA Calculator

Now that we have a good grasp of the concept, let's explore how to use the GPA calculator effectively.

1. **Inputting Course Information**
    
    Begin by entering the name of each course along with the corresponding credit hours. For example, if you are taking a three-credit course in Mathematics and a four-credit course in History, input these details into the designated fields.
