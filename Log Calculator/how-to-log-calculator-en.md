**Understanding Logarithms:**

Before we dive into how to use the Log Calculator, let's quickly review what logarithms are and why they are important in mathematics.

A logarithm is the inverse operation of exponentiation. It helps us solve equations involving exponential functions and represents the power to which a base must be raised to obtain a given number. The logarithm of a number x to the base b is denoted as log<sub>b</sub>(x).

Logarithms have various applications in fields such as science, engineering, finance, and computer science. They are particularly useful for simplifying complex calculations and solving exponential growth or decay problems.
