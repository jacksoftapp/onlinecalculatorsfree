It records the number of clicks you make and calculates your CPS based on the duration of the test. Not only does it measure your click speed, but it also gives you an accuracy score, which indicates how precise your clicks are.

Step 3: Choose the test duration

Before starting the test, you can select the duration of your choice. The options typically range from 5 to 60 seconds. Consider your skill level and how long you want the test to be. Remember, the longer the duration, the more accurate your CPS will be.

1. Finger placement: Position your finger comfortably on the mouse button. Find a grip that allows you to click rapidly without straining your hand.
2. Practice regularly: Like any skill, click speed improves with practice. Set aside some time each day to practice clicking as quickly as possible. Over time, you'll notice significant progress.
3. Use the right equipment: Invest in a good quality mouse that is comfortable and responsive. A mouse with programmable buttons can also give you an edge in certain games.
4. Warm-up exercises: Before starting a click speed test, warm up your fingers by doing some quick finger exercises or stretches. This can help improve your finger dexterity and speed.
5. Focus on accuracy: While speed is important, accuracy is equally crucial. Aim to make precise and deliberate clicks rather than random or hasty ones. Accuracy will help you perform better in games and achieve higher scores.
