**Understanding Volumetric Weight**

Before we delve into the details of the Volumetric Weight Calculator, let's first understand what volumetric weight is. Volumetric weight, also known as dimensional weight, is a calculation used by shipping companies to determine the amount of space a package occupies in relation to its actual weight. This is particularly important when shipping bulky items that may take up more space than their actual weight suggests.

Shipping costs are often based on either the actual weight or the volumetric weight of a package, depending on which one is higher. By accurately determining the volumetric weight of your shipments, you can avoid unexpected shipping charges and plan your logistics more effectively.
