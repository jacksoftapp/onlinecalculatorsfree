How to Use Rankine to Celsius Conversion Online Tool
====================================================

Temperature is a crucial component of our daily lives, and we often find ourselves in need of converting temperatures from one unit of measurement to another. The Rankine to Celsius conversion online tool is a convenient and easy-to-use resource that helps you do just that. This article will provide you with a basic understanding of Rankine and Celsius scales and how to use the online tool.

### Rankine and Celsius Scales

The Rankine scale is a temperature scale that uses absolute zero as its starting point. In this scale, zero degrees Rankine (0°R) is equal to absolute zero (-459.67°F). The Rankine scale is used primarily in the United States, and it is not as commonly used as Celsius or Fahrenheit.

On the other hand, the Celsius scale is the most widely used temperature scale in the world. It uses the freezing point of water (0°C) and the boiling point of water (100°C) at standard atmospheric pressure as reference points. One degree Celsius (1°C) is equal to one Kelvin (1K).

### Using the Rankine to Celsius Conversion Tool

To use the Rankine to Celsius conversion online tool, follow the steps below:

Step 1: Open the Rankine to Celsius conversion tool website using the link provided above.
