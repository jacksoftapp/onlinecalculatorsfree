How to Use Kelvin to Celsius Conversion Online Tool
===================================================

Temperature conversion is a common task when working with different units of measurement. One common conversion is from Kelvin (K) to Celsius (째C) degrees. To simplify this process, an online tool can be utilized to quickly and accurately convert temperatures between these two units. In this article, we will introduce the basic knowledge of the Kelvin to Celsius conversion tool and provide a step-by-step guide on how to use it effectively.

### Understanding Kelvin and Celsius

Kelvin and Celsius are two widely used temperature scales. While both are used to measure temperature, they have different starting points and intervals.

The Kelvin scale, named after the Scottish physicist William Thomson, starts at absolute zero (-273.15째C) and measures temperature in increments of one Kelvin (K). It is commonly used in scientific and engineering applications where precise temperature calculations are required.

The Celsius scale, on the other hand, is based on the freezing and boiling points of water. It has 100 degrees between the freezing point (0째C) and boiling point (100째C) of water at sea level. The Celsius scale is commonly used in everyday life and most countries around the world.
