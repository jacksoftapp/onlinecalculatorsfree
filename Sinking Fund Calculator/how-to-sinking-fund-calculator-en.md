### Understanding the Sinking Fund

A sinking fund is a type of savings account specifically designed to accumulate funds over time. It is commonly used to save for future expenses, such as buying a new car, renovating a house, or planning for retirement. By making regular contributions to a sinking fund, you can ensure that you have enough money available when the time comes to fulfill your financial obligations.

The key concept behind a sinking fund is to set aside a fixed amount of money at regular intervals. This predetermined contribution helps you build up savings gradually, minimizing the financial burden when the expense needs to be incurred. Additionally, the sinking fund can also earn interest or investment returns, further boosting the funds available for your future use.
