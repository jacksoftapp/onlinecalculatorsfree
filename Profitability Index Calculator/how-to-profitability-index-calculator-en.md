The Profitability Index (PI), also known as the Profit Investment Ratio (PIR) or the Benefit-Cost Ratio (BCR), measures the relationship between the present value of expected future cash flows and the initial investment. It indicates the profitability of an investment by determining the ratio of the project's benefits to its costs.

The formula to calculate the Profitability Index is as follows:

Profitability Index = PV of Future Cash Flows / Initial Investment

A profitability index greater than 1 suggests a potentially profitable investment, while a value less than 1 indicates the opposite. Therefore, the higher the profitability index, the more financially viable the investment or project may be.
