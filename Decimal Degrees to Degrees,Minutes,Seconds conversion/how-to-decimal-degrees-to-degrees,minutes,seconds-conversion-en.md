How to Use a Decimal Degrees to Degrees, Minutes, Seconds Conversion Online Tool
================================================================================

Are you looking to convert decimal degrees into degrees, minutes, and seconds? Whether you are a student, a researcher, or simply someone who needs to work with geographic coordinates, an online tool can make this conversion process quick and easy. In this article, we will introduce you to a reliable online tool and guide you on how to use it effectively.

### Understanding Decimal Degrees

Before diving into the conversion process, let's first understand what decimal degrees are. Decimal degrees (DD) is a common format used to represent geographic coordinates. It expresses latitude and longitude values as decimal fractions instead of degrees, minutes, and seconds (DMS).

In the decimal degrees format, latitude values range from -90° (representing the South Pole) to +90° (representing the North Pole), while longitude values range from -180° to +180° (representing the western and eastern hemispheres, respectively).
