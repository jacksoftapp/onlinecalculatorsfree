In this article, we will introduce the basic knowledge of this tool and guide you through its usage.

### Understanding Expected Value

Before we delve into how to use the Expected Value Calculator, let's briefly discuss what expected value is and why it is important. In probability theory, the expected value of a random variable represents the average value that we can expect to obtain when repeated experiments are performed.

The expected value is a fundamental concept in statistics and decision theory. It provides valuable insights into the long-term behavior of random variables and helps us make predictions based on available data. By calculating the expected value, we can assess the central tendency and anticipate the likely outcomes of a random variable.
