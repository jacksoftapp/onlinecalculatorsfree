How to Use PPB to PPM Conversion Online Tool
============================================

If you work in fields such as environmental science, chemistry, or engineering, you might encounter the need to convert measurements from parts per billion (ppb) to parts per million (ppm). While it is possible to do this calculation manually, it can be time-consuming and prone to errors. Fortunately, there are online tools available that can help you perform this conversion quickly and accurately.

One such tool is the PPB to PPM Conversion Calculator offered by Online Calculators Free. In this article, we will introduce the basics of ppb and ppm conversions, and then show you how to use this calculator.

**What are PPB and PPM?**

PPB and PPM are units of measurement used to express the concentration of a substance in a solution or gas mixture. PPB stands for parts per billion, which means there are one billion parts of a substance per one part of the total solution or gas mixture. PPM, on the other hand, stands for parts per million, which means there are one million parts of a substance per one part of the total solution or gas mixture.

For example, if you have a solution that contains 1 ppb of substance X, that means there is one part of substance X for every one billion parts of the solution. Similarly, if you have a solution that contains 1 ppm of substance Y, that means there is one part of substance Y for every one million parts of the solution.

**How to Use the PPB to PPM Conversion Calculator**
