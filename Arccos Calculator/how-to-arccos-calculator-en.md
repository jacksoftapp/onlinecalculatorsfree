How to Use Arccos Calculator Online Tool
========================================

Arccos(x) calculator is an online tool that helps calculate the inverse cosine (arccos) of a given value. The arccos function is the inverse of the cosine function, which means that it returns the angle whose cosine is the given value. The arccos function finds its application in various fields like physics, engineering, and mathematics.

Using the arccos calculator online tool can simplify the process of finding the arccos value. In this article, we will discuss the basic knowledge of this tool and how to use it effectively.

### What is Arccos Function?

The arccos function is the inverse of the cosine function, which means that it returns the angle whose cosine is the given value. It is also known as the inverse cosine function. The arccos function is defined only for values between -1 and 1. The output of the arccos function is always an angle in radians or degrees.

The arccos function can be calculated using the formula:

arccos(x) = cos<sup>-1</sup>(x)

For example, if we want to find the arccos value of 0.5, we can use the arccos formula:

arccos(0.5) = cos<sup>-1</sup>(0.5) = 60째

This means that the angle whose cosine is 0.5 is 60째.
