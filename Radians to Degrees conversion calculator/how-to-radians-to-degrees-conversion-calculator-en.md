### Understanding Radians and Degrees

Before diving into the functionality of the Radians to Degrees Conversion Calculator, let's briefly understand what radians and degrees represent in the world of mathematics.

Radians are a unit of measurement used for angles in trigonometry. It is defined as the ratio between the length of an arc and the radius of a circle. One radian is equal to the angle subtended by an arc of length equal to the radius of the circle.

On the other hand, degrees are the more commonly known unit of measurement for angles. A circle is divided into 360 degrees, with each degree representing 1/360th part of a full rotation.
