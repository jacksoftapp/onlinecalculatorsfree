As an investor or business owner, it is important to make informed decisions about your assets and investments. One vital aspect of asset management is calculating depreciation over time. Depreciation is the decrease in value of an asset due to wear and tear, aging, or obsolescence. The percentage depreciation calculator is a useful online tool that helps to calculate asset depreciation using the declining balance method. This article will introduce you to this tool and provide a step-by-step guide on how to use it.

**Understanding Percentage Depreciation Calculator**

The percentage depreciation calculator is an online tool that calculates the depreciation of an asset using the declining balance method. The declining balance method is a type of accelerated depreciation method where the depreciation expenses are higher in the early years of an asset's life and decrease over time. This method is commonly used for assets that have a high rate of obsolescence or wear and tear, such as machinery, vehicles, and computers.

The percentage depreciation calculator uses the following inputs to calculate the asset's depreciation:

• Cost of the asset: The original cost of the asset when it was purchased;

• Salvage value: The estimated value of the asset at the end of its useful life;

• Useful life: The number of years the asset is expected to be in use;

• Depreciation rate: The rate at which the asset depreciates each year.

The tool then calculates the percentage of depreciation over time and provides a detailed report that can be used for financial planning and decision making.
