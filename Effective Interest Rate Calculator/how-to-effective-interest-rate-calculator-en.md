### Understanding Effective Interest Rate

Before we delve into the details of the calculator, let's first understand what effective interest rate is. The effective interest rate, also known as the annual equivalent rate (AER), represents the true cost of borrowing over a specific period. It takes into account both the nominal interest rate and the compounding frequency.

Many financial institutions advertise their loan offerings with nominal interest rates, but these rates may not fully reflect the actual cost of borrowing. The effective interest rate, on the other hand, provides a more accurate measure by considering the compounding effect.
