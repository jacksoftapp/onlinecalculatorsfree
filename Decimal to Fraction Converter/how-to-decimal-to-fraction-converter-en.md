====================================================

If you're working with numbers, chances are you've had to convert decimal numbers into fractions at some point. Maybe it was in a math class or while working on a project at work. Whatever the reason, converting decimals to fractions can be a cumbersome process. Fortunately, there are online tools that make this process much easier. In this article, we'll take a look at how to use a decimal to fraction converter online tool and explore the benefits of doing so.

### What is a Decimal to Fraction Converter Online Tool?

Before we dive into how to use a decimal to fraction converter online tool, let's first explore what it is and how it works. As the name suggests, this tool is designed to convert decimal numbers into fractions. It does so by taking the decimal number and breaking it down into its individual parts. These parts are then used to create a fraction that represents the original decimal number.

For example, let's say you have the decimal number 0.75. Using a decimal to fraction converter online tool, this would be converted into the fraction 3/4. The tool takes the decimal number and splits it into two parts: the whole number and the decimal portion. In this case, the whole number is 0 and the decimal portion is 0.75. The decimal portion is then converted into a fraction by dividing it by 1 and multiplying both the numerator and denominator by the same number until the decimal is eliminated.
