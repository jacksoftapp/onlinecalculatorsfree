WACC takes into account the proportion of each capital component and provides a single discount rate that can be used to evaluate potential investments.

To calculate WACC, several components need to be considered, including the cost of equity, cost of debt, tax rate, and the proportion of debt and equity in the company's capital structure. These calculations can be complex and time-consuming when done manually, making the use of a dedicated WACC Calculator highly beneficial.
