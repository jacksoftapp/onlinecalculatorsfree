Understanding the Basics
------------------------

Before we delve into the details of using the Compile Ada Online tool, let's take a moment to understand some basic concepts related to Ada programming.

Ada is a high-level programming language that was developed by the United States Department of Defense for mission-critical systems. It is known for its strong typing, safety features, and support for parallel programming. Ada is widely used in industries such as aerospace, defense, and transportation.

The Compile Ada Online tool provides an integrated development environment (IDE) where you can write, compile, and execute Ada programs. It uses the GNAT compiler, which is one of the most popular Ada compilers available.
