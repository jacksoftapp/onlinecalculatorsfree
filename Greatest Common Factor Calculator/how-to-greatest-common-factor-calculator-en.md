How to Use the Greatest Common Factor (GCF) Calculator Online Tool
==================================================================

Are you struggling to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of a set of numbers? Look no further! Our free GCF calculator is here to simplify your calculations and help you uncover the GCF effortlessly. Whether you are a student, a teacher, or just someone interested in math, this online tool will prove to be invaluable.

### Understanding the Greatest Common Factor (GCF)

The greatest common factor, also known as the greatest common divisor, is the largest number that divides evenly into a given set of numbers. It is commonly used in various mathematical operations, such as simplifying fractions, finding equivalent ratios, and solving algebraic equations.

Before we delve into how to use the GCF calculator, let's quickly review the basic concepts behind finding the GCF:

- **Divisibility:** A number is divisible by another number if it can be divided evenly without leaving a remainder. For example, 12 is divisible by both 3 and 4.
- **Prime Numbers:** Prime numbers are numbers that are only divisible by 1 and themselves. Examples include 2, 3, 5, 7, and so on.
- **Factorization:** To find the GCF, we need to factorize each number into its prime factors. This involves breaking down a number into a product of prime numbers. For example, 12 can be factorized as 2 x 2 x 3.

### Using the GCF Calculator
