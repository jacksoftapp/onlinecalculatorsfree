Whether you are a student, engineer, or simply curious about frequency conversions, this tool will prove to be invaluable. In this article, we will introduce the basic knowledge of this tool and guide you through the process of using it effectively.

### Understanding Megahertz and Hertz

Before we dive into the tool itself, let's briefly understand the concepts of megahertz and hertz. Frequency is a measure of the number of cycles per second in a waveform. The unit of frequency is called hertz, which is abbreviated as Hz. One hertz equals one cycle per second. Megahertz, on the other hand, is equal to one million hertz. So, 1 MHz is equivalent to 1,000,000 Hz.
