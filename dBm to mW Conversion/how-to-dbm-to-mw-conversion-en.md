How to Use dBm to mW Conversion Online Tool
===========================================

Are you looking for a convenient and accurate way to convert dBm (decibel-milliwatts) to milliwatts (mW)? Look no further! Our dBm to mW Conversion Calculator is the perfect tool for your power conversion needs. In this article, we will provide you with a step-by-step guide on how to use this online tool effectively.

### Understanding dBm and mW

Before we dive into the functionality of the conversion tool, let's quickly understand what dBm and mW are. dBm is a unit of power measurement that compares the power level to 1 milliwatt (mW). It is commonly used in telecommunications, networking, and electronics.

Milliwatts (mW), on the other hand, are a direct measure of power in the International System of Units (SI). They represent one thousandth of a watt and are widely used to quantify power in various applications.
