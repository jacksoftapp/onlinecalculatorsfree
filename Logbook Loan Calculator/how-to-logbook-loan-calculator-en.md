Are you considering a logbook loan to get some extra cash? If so, you need to have a clear understanding of how much you can borrow and what you'll be paying in monthly instalments. Fortunately, there's a convenient online tool you can use to get this information quickly and easily.

The logbook loan calculator is an online tool that helps you estimate the amount you can borrow against your vehicle and the corresponding interest rates and monthly payments that come with it. In this article, we will discuss the basics of logbook loans and how to use the logbook loan calculator.

###  What is a logbook loan?

A logbook loan is a type of secured loan that uses your vehicle as collateral. This means that the lender has the right to take possession of your vehicle if you default on the loan. The amount you can borrow depends on the value of the vehicle and the lender's terms and conditions.

Logbook loans are often used as a last resort when other forms of credit are not available due to poor credit ratings or lack of credit history. While they can provide quick access to cash, they come with high-interest rates and strict repayment terms.

###  How does the logbook loan calculator work?

The logbook loan calculator is a simple online tool that requires you to input some details about yourself and your vehicle, including:

- The make and model of your vehicle
- The registration number of your vehicle
