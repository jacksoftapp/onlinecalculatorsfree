How to Use Loan to Value (LTV) Calculator Online Tool
=====================================================

When it comes to obtaining a mortgage or loan, one important factor that lenders consider is the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio. This ratio is a measure of the amount of the loan compared to the value of the property being financed. The higher the LTV ratio, the riskier the loan is for the lender. To help you determine your LTV ratio, there are online tools available such as the LTV calculator offered by Online Calculators Free.

**What is Loan to Value (LTV) Ratio?**

The loan-to-value (LTV) ratio is a calculation used to determine the amount of the loan compared to the value of the property being financed. This ratio is important to lenders because it helps them determine the level of risk associated with the loan. A higher LTV ratio means there is a greater risk of default, which means a higher likelihood of the lender losing money.

The LTV ratio is calculated by dividing the amount of the loan by the appraised value of the property. For example, if you are buying a house for $400,000 and you have a down payment of $100,000, then your loan amount would be $300,000. If the appraised value of the house is also $400,000, then your LTV ratio would be 75% ($300,000/$400,000).

An LTV calculator is an online tool that helps you calculate your LTV ratio. It is a convenient way to determine how much of a loan you can obtain based on the value of the property. The calculator takes into account the loan amount, the appraised value of the property, and any down payment you plan to make. The result is a percentage that represents your LTV ratio.

**What is Cumulative Loan to Value (CLTV) Ratio?**

The cumulative loan-to-value (CLTV) ratio is a calculation that takes into account all loans secured by a property. This includes primary mortgages, secondary mortgages, and home equity lines of credit. The CLTV ratio is used to determine the maximum amount of borrowing capacity available to a borrower.

The CLTV ratio is calculated by dividing the total of all loans secured by the property by the appraised value of the property. For example, if you have a primary mortgage of $200,000, a secondary mortgage of $50,000, and an appraised value of the property of $400,000, then your CLTV ratio would be 62.5% (($200,000 + $50,000)/$400,000).

**Why Use an LTV Calculator?**

Using an LTV calculator can help you understand your borrowing capacity and equity position. It can also help you make informed decisions about refinancing or obtaining new loans. By knowing your LTV ratio, you can negotiate better terms and interest rates with lenders. An LTV calculator can also help you determine if you need to purchase mortgage insurance, which is required for high LTV ratios.
