### Understanding SVG and PNG Formats

SVG is an XML-based vector image format that allows for high-quality graphics to be displayed on the web. It is widely supported by modern web browsers and provides a scalable and responsive solution for creating images and icons. Unlike raster image formats like JPG or PNG, SVG files consist of lines, curves, and shapes defined by mathematical equations. This means that SVG images can be scaled up or down without any loss of quality.

On the other hand, PNG is a bitmap image format that supports lossless compression. It is commonly used for web graphics, as it offers a good balance between file size and image quality. PNG files can contain transparent backgrounds and are ideal for images with sharp edges or text.
