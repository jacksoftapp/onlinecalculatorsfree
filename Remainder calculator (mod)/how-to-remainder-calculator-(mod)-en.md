How to Use the Remainder Calculator (Mod) Online Tool
=====================================================

Are you struggling with finding the remainder of a division operation? Look no further! With the help of the Remainder Calculator (Mod) online tool, you can easily determine the remainder using the modulo operator. Whether you need to calculate a remainder or perform a modulo calculation, this handy tool has got you covered. In this article, we will introduce the basic knowledge of this tool and guide you on how to use it effectively.

### Understanding the Modulo Operator

Before we delve into the functionality of the Remainder Calculator (Mod) online tool, let's first understand the concept of the modulo operator. The modulo operator, denoted by "%", calculates the remainder after division. It is commonly used in computer programming, mathematics, and various other fields.

For example, if we divide 17 by 5, the quotient is 3 and the remainder is 2. Using the modulo operator, we can express this as 17 % 5 = 2. This operator allows us to extract the remainder from any division operation quickly and efficiently.
