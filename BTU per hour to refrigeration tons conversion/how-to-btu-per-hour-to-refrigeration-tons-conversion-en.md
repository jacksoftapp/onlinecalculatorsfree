How to Use BTU per hour to Refrigeration Tons Conversion Online Tool
====================================================================

When it comes to air conditioning and refrigeration, one of the most important units of measurement is the BTU per hour (BTU/h), which is the amount of heat that an air conditioner or refrigerator can remove from a space in one hour. Another important unit of measurement is refrigeration tons (RT), which is the amount of heat removed by a one-ton air conditioning unit in one hour.

While these two units of measurement are commonly used in the industry, they are not directly interchangeable. This is where an online tool like the BTU to Tons of Refrigeration Conversion Calculator comes in handy. In this article, we will discuss how to use this tool to easily convert BTU/h to RT.

### Basic Knowledge of the Online Tool

The BTU to Tons of Refrigeration Conversion Calculator is a free, easy-to-use online tool that helps you convert BTU/h to RT. The tool uses a simple formula to convert the units, making it a valuable resource for HVAC technicians, engineers, and anyone who needs to work with air conditioning and refrigeration units.

### How to Use the Online Tool

Using the BTU to Tons of Refrigeration Conversion Calculator is simple and straightforward. To get started, follow these steps:

Step 1: Go to the website

Visit the website <https://www.onlinecalculatorsfree.com/convert/btu-to-ton.html>. This will take you to the homepage of the online tool.

Step 2: Enter the value of BTU/h

In the first text box labeled "BTU/hr," enter the value of BTU/h that you want to convert to RT. You can enter the value manually or use the up and down arrows to adjust the number.

Step 3: Choose the conversion type

Next, choose the type of conversion you want to perform. You can convert BTU/h to Tons of Refrigeration (RT) or Tons of Refrigeration (RT) to BTU/h. For this example, we will convert BTU/h to RT.

Step 4: Click "Calculate"

Once you have entered the value of BTU/h and chosen the conversion type, click on the "Calculate" button. The tool will instantly display the converted value in the text box labeled "Tons of Refrigeration (RT)."

Step 5: Repeat as needed

If you need to perform multiple conversions, simply repeat the process by entering a new value in the "BTU/hr" text box and clicking on "Calculate."

### Formula for Converting BTU/h to RT

While the online tool makes it easy to convert BTU/h to RT, it's also useful to understand the formula behind the conversion. The formula is as follows:

1 ton of refrigeration = 12,000 BTU per hour 1 BTU per hour = 8.33333 x 10^-5 tons of refrigeration

Using this formula, you can manually calculate the conversion between BTU/h and RT. However, using an online tool like the BTU to Tons of Refrigeration Conversion Calculator is much faster and easier.

### Conclusion

The BTU to Tons of Refrigeration Conversion Calculator is a valuable online tool for anyone who works with air conditioning and refrigeration units. By following the simple steps outlined above, you can easily convert BTU/h to RT and vice versa. Whether you are an HVAC technician, engineer, or simply someone who wants to better understand these units of measurement, this tool is a must-have resource.
