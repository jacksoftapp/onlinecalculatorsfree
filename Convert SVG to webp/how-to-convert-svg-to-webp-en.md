### Understanding SVG and Webp Formats

Before we delve into the details of the conversion process, let's first understand what SVG and Webp formats are.

1. Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG): SVG is a popular vector-based image format used for displaying graphics on the web. Unlike raster images, which are made up of pixels, SVG images are defined using mathematical equations, allowing them to be infinitely scaled without affecting the image quality. SVG files are widely supported by most modern web browsers.
2. Webp: Webp is an image format developed by Google that offers superior compression and quality compared to other image formats like JPEG and PNG. Webp files are typically smaller in size while maintaining excellent image quality, making them ideal for web use as they reduce the page load time.
