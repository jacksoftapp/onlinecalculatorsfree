In this article, we will introduce you to the Hex Calculator online tool and guide you through the process of using it effectively.

### Understanding Hexadecimal Numbers

Before diving into the workings of the Hex Calculator tool, let's quickly go over some basic knowledge about hexadecimal numbers. Unlike the decimal system that we commonly use, which is based on powers of 10, the hexadecimal system is based on powers of 16.
