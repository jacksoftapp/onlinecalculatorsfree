How to Use Footcandles to Lux Calculator Online Tool
====================================================

When it comes to measuring illuminance, two common units are footcandles (fc) and lux (lx). Understanding how to convert between these two units is crucial for various lighting applications. Fortunately, there are online tools available to simplify this conversion process. One such tool is the Footcandles to Lux Conversion Calculator, which allows users to effortlessly convert illuminance from footcandles to lux and vice versa.

Understanding Footcandles and Lux
---------------------------------

Before delving into the practical use of the online calculator, it's important to grasp the basic concepts of footcandles and lux. Footcandles, often abbreviated as fc, is a unit that measures illuminance in the imperial system. It represents the amount of light falling on a one-square-foot surface located one foot away from a single candle.

Lux, on the other hand, is the metric unit of illuminance and is defined as the amount of light that falls on a one-square-meter surface. The conversion between footcandles and lux is essential for individuals working with lighting in diverse settings, including photography, architecture, and engineering.
