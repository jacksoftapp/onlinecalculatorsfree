### Understanding Hexadecimal and Decimal Numbers

Before we delve into the details of the Hexadecimal to Decimal Converter, let's briefly understand what hexadecimal and decimal numbers are.

1. Hexadecimal Numbers: Hexadecimal, often abbreviated as "hex," is a number system that uses base-16. It consists of 16 unique symbols, including digits from 0 to 9 and letters A to F. In hexadecimal, the value of each digit increases by a power of 16, starting from the rightmost digit. For example, the hexadecimal number 2F7A represents (2 \* 16^3) + (15 \* 16^2) + (7 \* 16^1) + (10 \* 16^0) in decimal.
2. Decimal Numbers: Decimal, also known as the base-10 number system, is the most commonly used number system. It uses ten unique symbols (0-9) to represent values. Each digit in a decimal number has a place value based on powers of 10. For instance, the decimal number 3456 represents (3 \* 10^3) + (4 \* 10^2) + (5 \* 10^1) + (6 \* 10^0).
