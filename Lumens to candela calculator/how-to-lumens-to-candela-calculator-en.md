How to Use Lumens to Candela Calculator Online Tool
===================================================

If you are working with lighting fixtures, it's important to understand the relationship between lumens and candela. Lumens measure the total amount of light emitted by a source, while candela measures the intensity of that light in a certain direction. Knowing the conversion between these two units can help you choose the right lighting for your space.

Fortunately, there are online tools available that make this conversion easy. One such tool is the Lumens to Candela Calculator, which you can find at <https://www.onlinecalculatorsfree.com/tools/lumen-to-candela-calculator.html>. In this article, we will walk you through the basics of this tool and how to use it effectively.

### What is the Lumens to Candela Calculator?

The Lumens to Candela Calculator is an online tool that helps you convert lumens to candela. It works by using a simple formula to calculate the candela value based on the lumens and beam angle of the light source. This tool is useful for professionals working in the lighting industry, as well as for anyone who needs to determine the intensity of a light source in a specific direction.

### How to Use the Lumens to Candela Calculator

Using the Lumens to Candela Calculator is incredibly easy. Follow these simple steps to get started:

#### Step 1: Enter the Lumens Value

The first step is to enter the lumens value of the light source you want to convert. You can do this by typing the number into the "Lumens" field on the calculator.

#### Step 2: Enter the Beam Angle

Next, you need to enter the beam angle of the light source. This is the angle at which the light is emitted from the source. You can find this information on the packaging or specifications of the light source. If you don't have this information, you can enter a default value of 60 degrees.

#### Step 3: Calculate the Candela Value

Once you have entered the lumens and beam angle values, click on the "Calculate" button to get the candela value. The calculator will use the formula (Candela = Lumens / (4 \* pi \* (Beam Angle / 360)^2)) to calculate the candela value.

#### Step 4: Interpret the Results

The calculator will provide you with the candela value in the "Candela" field. This is the intensity of the light source in a specific direction. You can use this information to choose the right lighting for your space or to compare different lighting options.

### Conclusion

The Lumens to Candela Calculator is a useful tool for anyone working with lighting fixtures. It allows you to quickly and easily convert lumens to candela, which can help you choose the right lighting for your space. By following the steps we outlined in this article, you can use this tool effectively and make informed decisions about your lighting needs.
