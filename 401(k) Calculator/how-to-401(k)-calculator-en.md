### What is a 401(k) Retirement Calculator?

A 401(k) retirement calculator is an online tool designed to help individuals plan for their retirement. It provides an estimation of the potential growth of your 401(k) savings based on various factors such as your current savings balance, annual contribution, expected rate of return, and the number of years until retirement.

This calculator takes into account the power of compounding, which means your money can grow exponentially over time due to the reinvestment of earnings. By inputting different variables, you can get a better understanding of how your savings will accumulate and how they may impact your retirement goals.
