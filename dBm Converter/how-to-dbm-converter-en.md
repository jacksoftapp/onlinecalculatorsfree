### Understanding dBm

Before diving into the conversion process, let's briefly understand what dBm is. dBm is a unit of power measurement used in telecommunications, electronics, and radio frequency (RF) engineering. It represents power relative to one milliwatt (mW) on a logarithmic scale.

The logarithmic nature of dBm allows us to express a wide range of power levels more conveniently. Positive dBm values indicate power levels greater than one milliwatt, while negative dBm values represent power levels lower than one milliwatt. For example, +10 dBm corresponds to 10 milliwatts, while -20 dBm corresponds to 0.01 milliwatts.
